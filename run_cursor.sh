# while providing logging and error handling capabilities.

# TODO: Implement the following functions:
# - parse_arguments(): Parse command line arguments for task file and options
# - setup_environment(): Prepare workspace and environment for task execution
# - validate_task_input(): Ensure task JSON is valid and contains required fields
# - execute_cursor_command(): Run the actual Cursor CLI command with task input
# - capture_output(): Capture and process Cursor CLI output and errors
# - cleanup_workspace(): Clean up temporary files and reset workspace state
# - log_execution(): Write execution logs and results to memory/ directory
# - main(): Main execution flow for single task processing

# TODO: Implement main execution logic
